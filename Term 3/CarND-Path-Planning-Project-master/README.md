## Implementation Discussion

# Implementation
In my implementation I roughly followed the approach as discussed in the provided walk-through video.

In general, the implementation consists of a number of sections:

* Trajectory generation: the car's trajectory path is computed, using both previous path points as provided by the simulator, appended by newly generated path points using splines. In *lines 380 to 397 (main.cpp)* inital points are created in case there are no previous path points yet, using car position (Note a short procedure is implemented to make sure waypoints are in ascending order). Previous path points are then appended, and finally waypoints up to 90m ahead of the car (*lines 425 to 435*). The generated waypoinst (stored in *ptsx* and *ptsy*, respectively) are then fed into the mentioned spline. The spine points are in turn broken up (as explained in the walk-through), determining points 30 meters into x direction, computing y and finally (since in cars coordinates) rotating back to global coordinates.

* A simple cost function is implemented, using a cost function to decide which lane to follow. To decide which lane to follow, sensor fusion data is used. The implementation defines a variable *look_ahead* (defined in *line 185 main.cpp*) which defines the range the car looks ahead; all cars further ahead are ignored. The cost function now checks how far ahead from our car a lane is free by subtracting the distance from our car to each car as provided by sensor fusion, and subtracting this difference from the range the car looks ahead. This gives a simple measurement, denoting the free space between our car and the other cars for each lane. To decide which lane to follow, each car as provided by sensor fusion is assigned to the lane it is in; the lane with the longest free lane in front of our car is the target lane the car tries to follow. In code this means each car's cost is calculated and added to the respective lane the car is in. Finally, once all cars are assessed accordingly, the cheapest lane is the chosen target lane (line *318f*).

* The implementation also uses sensor fusion data to identify other cars' positions; that is, the car tries to follow the target lane as described above, while checking that lane changes are safe (l*ines 288 to 311 in main.cpp*). Also, the car makes sure not to bump into preceding, slower cars and omits lane changes in case faster cars approach from behind (which is mostly an issue at the start, where our car sits still while potentially be approached by other, faster cars). In addition, a *"dampening"* feature is implemented: Once a lane change is complete, the car is forced to maintain this lane for at least one second (see *lane_change_dampening in lines 337 and 341*). The same is true at progam start: the car is forced to maintain its lane for the first second (to avoid collisions due to fast cars from behind).

### Simulator. You can download the Term3 Simulator BETA which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
