    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "As for the video  challenges,  the draw_lines function has been  modified significantly. In particular, it first tries to differentiate left and right lanes, respectively. Moreover, the gradient is restricted by two gradient threshold values in an attempt to rule out non-lane lines.\n",

    "Shortcomings:\n",
    "The algorithm so far detects edges which are roughly sloped as seems plausible. It is, however, not capable of differentiating between lane lines or other lines potentially resembling lane edges, as for example patchwork on the  road surface, side verges running in parallel to the lane lines or even vehicles driving in parallel (and perhaps with similar speeds). \n",
    "After all, the algorithm so far detects edges with roughly similar characteristics as lane lines. It does not check for other potentially interesting attributes (e.g. cars  driving in parallel result in moving edges, which is implausible, assuming edges belong to lane lines).\n",
    "An obvious shortcoming might be the fact that lines are only detected for one image at any one time. It seems reasonable to somehow store detected edges and follow them along as the sequence of images in a video passes by. This way, line detection and the subsequent procedure of averaging lines could be accomplished in a much smoother way. \n",
